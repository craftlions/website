question: Why wouldn't I just hire a full-time employee?
answer: craftlions offers a flexible alternative to hiring full-time employees. By working with us, you gain access to experts without the overhead costs of recruitment, salaries, and benefits. We provide on-demand services tailored to your needs. Hiring a full-time employee can easily run upwards of â‚¬100k annually. And what if you don't have a consistent workload to justify that investment? You'd be shouldering costs for underutilized time. Opt for the flexible monthly plan instead. You have the freedom to pause and restart your subscription based on your actual business needs, ensuring you pay only for what you truly require.
