question: Why wouldn't I just hire a full-time employee?
answer: craftlions offers a flexible alternative to hiring full-time employees. By working with us, you gain access to a diverse team of experts without the overhead costs of recruitment, salaries, and benefits. We provide on-demand support tailored to your needs, allowing you to scale resources up or down as required. Hiring a full-time staff member can easily run upwards of â‚¬100k annually, not to mention the added burden of benefits. And what if you don't have a consistent workload to justify that investment? You'd be shouldering costs for underutilized time. Opt for the flexible monthly plan instead. You have the freedom to pause and restart your subscription based on your actual business needs, ensuring you pay only for what you truly require.
