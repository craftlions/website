question: How does the pause feature work?
answer: If your month isn't packed with requests, simply hit pause on your subscription. Enjoy the freedom to pick up where you left off when you're set to resume. Our billing operates on a 25-day cycle. For instance, if you use our service for 15 days and then pause, you'll still have a bank of 10 days, ready and waiting for whenever you need them.
