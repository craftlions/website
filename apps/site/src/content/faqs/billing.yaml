question: When will I be billed?
answer: Your billing cycle is determined by the subscription plan you selected when signing up for craftlions' services. Common billing cycles include monthly, quarterly, or annually. You will be billed on the designated billing date of your subscription plan. This date is typically set based on the date you initially subscribed to our services. craftlions operates on a pre-paid model, meaning you are billed in advance for the upcoming billing period. For example, if you have a monthly subscription plan, you will be billed for the upcoming month's service at the beginning of each month.
