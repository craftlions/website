question: When will I be billed?
answer: Our subscription plans are offered with monthly and anually billing cycles. We operate on a pre-paid model, meaning you are billed in advance for the upcoming billing cycle. For example, if you have a monthly subscription plan, you will be billed for the upcoming month's service at the beginning of each month.
